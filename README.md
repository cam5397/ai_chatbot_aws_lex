# ai_chatbot_aws_lex

This git repository is made for the Autonation Challenge at ShellHacks 2021.

The goal for this project was to create a bot which could recieve SMS messages and maintain conversations with customers regarding specific queries. If those quereies were not found by the bot then a default response would be presented. A demonstration is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3r_evn129Y&t=9s

Two files have been uploaded here: a zipped export of the AWS Lex chatbot (which could be imported directly into Lex) and an unzipped version of the same file.
